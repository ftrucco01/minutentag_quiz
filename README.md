# Minutentag PHP Functionality Overview

This repository contains a collection of PHP scripts designed to demonstrate various functionalities for the Minutentag company. The solutions address common programming tasks, showcasing data processing, API requests, and string manipulation.

## Contents

1. **Function Explanation**: Documentation and detailed breakdown of a given PHP function, explaining its purpose, iterations, and conditionals. This serves to clarify the logic and utility behind specific backend operations.

2. **LetterCounter Class**: A static method `CountLettersAsString` within the `LetterCounter` class, designed to count the frequency of each letter in a given string. The output is formatted as a string where each letter's frequency is represented by asterisks (`*`). Example usage and results are provided for clarity and testing.

3. **Date Fetching and Formatting**: A method that performs a GET request to the `http://date.jsontest.com/` API, parsing the JSON response to extract and display the current date and time in a readable format, e.g., "Monday 14th of August, 2023 - 06:47 PM". This showcases handling external API requests and date formatting.

4. **Response Sorting Method**: This function makes a request to `http://echo.jsontest.com/...`, parsing the response to categorize and print names based on binary responses ('yes' or 'no'). The output is formatted in two columns for easy comparison, demonstrating data parsing and organization.

## Objective

The primary goal of these scripts is to provide practical PHP solutions for common programming challenges encountered by Minutentag developers. These examples aim to improve efficiency, understanding, and application of PHP in various contexts, including API interaction, data manipulation, and conditional logic.

## Usage

Each script can be run in a PHP-supported environment, requiring no additional libraries apart from cURL for API requests. Users can test, modify, and implement these solutions within their projects, adhering to Minutentag's coding standards and practices.
